Before this course, I had little knowledge of software development. However, by studying for this assessment, I was able to learn more about Python. I still have much to learn and gain experience in, but I am excited to continue my journey.

I completed the course modules and used the W3Schools Python tutorial to better understand the concepts. I learned that being resourceful is essential in coding, and that curiosity is one of the best qualities to have when trying to solve problems. I also asked friends for help with my code.

I have submitted my code, a README file, files that inspired my code, and a reflection on what I found interesting while learning Python.
